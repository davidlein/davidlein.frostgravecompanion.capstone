Players must decide amongst themselves if they should declare the campaign over, or if they should continue with the remaining wizards to see if any of them can also obtain Transcendence. In such a case, the player who has just won should be allowed to create a new wizard and warband (probably at a somewhat more advanced LEVEL) in order to continue playing. With the other players’ agreement, they can promote their apprentice to be their new wizard, but this apprentice will be so close to reaching Transcendence themselves that it may seem a bit redundant.', NULL);
